# Itemis Aufgabe 1
Problem 1 implemented in Angular with english documentation (as the problem was posed in English). 

This project is divided in three directories: model, service and view. 
The Model describes the objects to be managed in this application. In this case the goods. 
The Service describes the manager of said objects. In this app it manages goods that will be bought.
The View is the GUI for the app. It allows the users to interact with the application.

The main purpose of the view is to be an example of how to use the service when implemented in another Application.
